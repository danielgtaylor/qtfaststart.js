Quicktime/MP4 Fast Start Javascript Port
========================================
This is a port of the qtfaststart.py script for moving the metadata of
Quicktime MOV/MP4/M4A/M4V/F4V/etc files to the head of the file for faster
and simpler online streaming.

The client-side javascript implementation of this script allows for the
creation of:
  
  * Client-side file manipulation before upload
  * Client-side web applications to manage local files
  * Client-side metadata parsing
  * And more!

Requirements
------------
Currently this code relies on HTML5 File APIs for local file system access.
You must use a browser that supports this API.

Usage
-----
Below is an example of how to use this code:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="qtfaststart.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      QtFastStart.onChunkReady = function (file, current, total, data) {
        alert("Got chunk " + current + " of " + total + " (" + data.length + " bytes)");
      }
    </script>
    <input type="file" onChange="QtFastStart.process(this);">
